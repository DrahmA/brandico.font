"Crowdsourced" collection of popular logos, mostly for use in fontello. Since
it's not good to duplicate logos in every custom font, we did a separate-one.

We have no goal to collect all possible logos here. Only those, that used with
texts:

- icons for links to pages in social networks
- messengers icons
- "login via..." icons
